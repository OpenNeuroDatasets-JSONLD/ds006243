Dataset Description 

This dataset contains only MNI‐normalized BOLDs from fMRIPrep.

- 54 fMRI subjects undergoing pain empathy task. 
- Preregistration: https://osf.io/agbu5 

Experiment Times and Details

- 30 trials
    - 30 cues (15 neutral, 15 pain)
    - 30 anticipation (15 neutral, 15 pain)
    - 30 stimulation (10 pain, 20 no pain)
    - 30 rest (10 pain, 20 no pain)

- 1 trial = 24 seconds
    - 3 s auditory signal for anticipation or safety
    - 3-12 s anticipation
    - 6 s pain stimulation
    - 3-12 rest 

- full trial and experiment
    - 15 (anticipation + rest) + 9 (cue + stimulation) —> 24 (full trial length) 
    - EXPERIMENT IS 720 s in TOTAL

- CFMI acquisition time is 750 s (see json file in func)
    - subtract 10 s until scanner is ready - that is when task actually begins, this we subtract in the beginning from events and confounds (4 volumes, already subtracted before preprocessing)
